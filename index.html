		<h1>The Green Empower Organization</h1>


		<h2>Drafting and Construction</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the Green Empower Organization.</p>
		<p>My name is Holden Green (<a href="http://holdengreen.org">holdengreen.org</a>). Contact me at <a href="mailto:me@holdengreen.org">me@holdengreen.org</a> or <a href="holdenmgreen@gmail.com">holdenmgreen@gmail.com</a> if you are interested in Green Empower or would like to be added to our channels or anything else.</p>
		<p>Green Empower is a intersectional liberation and altruistic collective anarchist organization working to fix some of our biggest issues and to empower, elevate and develop humanity and society.</p>
		<p>Green Empower seeks to rebuild society from the ground up.</p>
		<p>"For every genius we see rise to glory, there are millions or even billions squandered by society, never to give their ideas to the world" - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJaiJZahtWPOXH7OegWowmA">Vtron</a> </p>
		<p>"I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein's brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a></p>
		<p>Green Empower will promote mass cooperation and altruism. In many ways we believe that a person should be judged by how they treat other people.
		<p>We seek solutions. Life is complicated not every issue has an easy remedy, but... What sets us apart is that we try to keep our focus broad and this allows us to analyze issues holisticly and find intersectionality. Ultimately allowing us to get to the root of our problems.</p>
		<p>Change happens when common people are empowered to fight for their liberation.</p>
		<p>The full scope of Green Empower is still being determined; but: Green Empower may eventually operate as a member owned investing, charity, public interest and progressive activism organization.</p>
		<p>Green Empower will conduct research and create and provide many services and goods. Some of our functions may have to directly compensate for where our society is seriously lacking.</p>
		<p>A main function of Green Empower will be to generate income in generally non-destructive ways and redistribute that periodically to individuals without discrimination. (Essentially a Universal Basic Income program)</p>
		<p>A main function of Green Empower will be to provide migratory and travel services. Everyone should have the right to travel and choose where they want to live.</p>
		<p>Initial areas of research include: cheaper living innovation and alternatives, social media services, gaming and interactive simulation <a href="http://voxim.org">(Voxim)</a>, media, entertainment, music and propaganda <a href="http://greenie.media">(Greenie Media)</a>, complex large scale media manipulation and management, mesh + cryptography tech, digital and physical decentralization of production and more, mass collaboration, travel, mobility, migration and exploration, karma and social currency (<a href="./karma">karma</a>), judicial and legislative pursuits, rewilding, party and celebratory services and products (<a href="./party">party</a>), resiliency mechanisms, combating human trafficking (<a href="./trafficking">trafficking</a>).</p>
		<p>I will use this organization to delegate ownership over my projects and research. <strike>I will soon infuse Green Empower with about $3000 in currency and assets.</strike></p>
		<p>I am in the process of drafting initial founding document/documents which will likely be hosted on this website. Concurrently I am also working on marketing, graphics, symbolism and outreach among other things. Email if interested!</p>

		<h1>Schema</h2>
		<!--<p>Green Empower fights terror and imperialism wherever it may be.</p>-->
		<!--<p>We name <a href="./saints">saints</a> who represent our ideals.</p>-->
		<p>We fix everyday injustices.</p>
		<p>Wie avoid competition generally in favor of cooperation.</p>
		<p>We are anticapitalist.</p>
		<p>We support rule by the many rather than the few. The many are better equipped to address their issues than the few who are out of touch.</p>

		<h2>Internationalism</h2>
			<p>Aspects of Green Empower need to be International. The US government and the Capitalist class have a huge capacity to crush us domenstically. I believe that to overthrow the systems that oppress us we need to seek cooperation abroad.</p>
			<p>Nationalism is a problem. Culture can be exchanged healthilly and fruitfully.</p>

		<h1>Issues and Areas of Investigation</h1>
		<h2>Inequality</h2>
		<h2>Poverty</h2>
		<h3>Wealth Disparity</h3>
			<p>Wealth Disparity is the most precient disparity that I know of. We are increadibly unequal in the USA and the world when it comes to wealth. This is probably the worst inequality issue, because of it's impact on peoples lives.</p>
			<p>There at least 100k people (probably more) in the USA living with obcene wealth, where others live in quander.</p>
		<h2>Monopoly</h2>
		<h3>Social/Cultural Monopoly</h3>
			<p>It's an issue when groups try to monopolize ideas (ex. The American right tries to monopolize guns and law and order.)</p>
		<h3>Intellectualism</h3>
			<p>I take issue with how academia has monopolized intellectualism. That's an issue, because intellectualism exists outside of academic heirarchy and bureaucracy. When people associate intellectualism with this there is an issue.</p>
		<h4>Productivity</h4>
			<p>Different political groups and entities try to monopolize productivity. You may see a politician, a political pundent or an entire political party trying to suggest that we, he, or she will 'get things done'. This is toxic.</p>
		<h2>Social / Cultural</h2>
			<h3>Social / Cultural Performance</h3>
				<p>People are often coerced into perfoming a role for society that may not benefit them. For example, toxic masculinity may force a young male into being something he is not physically or mentally incline to be. Or, a smart young man may be coerced to act in a scholarly way or to achieve in school, even though this is not his inclination.</p>
		<h2>Neoliberalism</h2>
			<p>Neoliberalism is weak and reactionary ideology. It can't exist without facism. When facism fades neoliberalism looses its purpose, which is to act as an alternative to facism.</p>
		<h2>Segregation</h2>
		<h2>Oppression</h2>
		<h2>Eugenics</h2>
			<p>This is an issue.</p>

		<h2>Ableism</h2>
		<h2>Conformity</h2>
		<h2>World Bank</h2>
			<p>Aparently the World Bank artificially creates poverty by manufacturing and altering that standard to advance their own aims and make capitalism look good.</p>

		<h2>Propriety</h2>
		<h2>Imperialist and Capitalist Intervention</h2>
			<p>The US and others have famously intervened in communist and socialist experiments.</p>
			<h3>Death Squads</h3>
				<p>In Nicaragua the US funded the Contras to go around and mass rape, torture, mutulate and kill people to stop the Communist Sandenistas.</p>

		<h2>Scarcity</h2>
			<p>How does scarcity effect peoples minds and experiences? Does growing up poor predispose you to act greedily?</p>

		<h2>Overton Window</h2>
		<h2>Bullying</h2>


		<br>

		<h1>Reactionary</h1>
		<h2>Capitalism</h2>
			<p>We are proudly anticapitalist. We strive to offer something new, useful and meaningful. Capitalist beliefs aren't going to get us there.</p>
			<h3>Schemery</h3>
				<p>We document capitalist schemery.</p>
		<h2>Intellectualism</h2>
			<p>We are experiencing a rising anti-intellectual movement in America and abroad. It is an issue and is something that needs to be addressed.</p>
		<h2>Intolerance</h2>
			<p>It's hard to be tolerant when in comes to intolerance. Can intolerance be tolerated?</p>
		<h2>Existencialism</h2>
		<h2>Jealousy</h2>

		<br>

		<h1>Philosophy</h1>
		<h2>Indulgence</h2>
			<p>At what point is self-indulgence dangerous?</p>
		<h2>Virtue</h2>
		<h3>Weakness and Virtue</h3>
			<p>Weakness is not a lack of virtue. Society needs to recognize this.</p>

		<h2>Individualism</h2>
		<h2>Homogeneity</h2>
		<h2>Divide and Conquer.</h2>
		<h2>Divisions</h2>
			<p>How to handle the divisions among us?</p>
		<h2>Spheres of Influence</h2>
		<h2>Freedom</h2>
		<h2>Emotionality</h2>
			<p>I am developing Neo-Emotionality for cultural and propagandistic use.</p>
			<h3>NeoMasculinity</h3>
			<h3>NeoFemininity</h3>
