		<h2>Drafting and Construction</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the Green Empower Organization.</p>
		<p>My name is Holden Green (<a href="http://holdengreen.org">holdengreen.org</a>). Contact me at <a href="holdenmgreen@gmail.com">holdenmgreen@gmail.com</a> or <a href="mailto:me@holdengreen.org">me@holdengreen.org</a>..</p>
		<p>If you are interested in Green Empower or would like to be added to our channels or anything else, please us one of these addresses: <a href="mailto:realgreenempower@gmail.com">realgreenempower@gmail.com</a> or <a href="mailto:holden@greenempower.org">holden@greenempower.org</a>.</p>
		<p>Green Empower is a intersectional liberation and altruistic collective anarchist organization working to fix some of our biggest issues and to empower, elevate and develop humanity and society.</p>
		<p>Green Empower aims to rethink society from the ground up and to apply this to our plans and actions.</p>
		<p>"For every genius we see rise to glory, there are millions or even billions squandered by society, never to give their ideas to the world" - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJaiJZahtWPOXH7OegWowmA">Vtron</a> </p>
		<p>"I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein's brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a></p>
		<p>Green Empower will promote mass cooperation and altruism. In many ways we believe that a person should be judged by how they treat other people.
		<p>We seek solutions. Life is complicated and not every issue has an easy remedy, but... What sets us apart is that we try to keep our focus broad and this allows us to analyze issues holisticly and find intersectionality. Ultimately allowing us to get to the root of our problems.</p>
		<p>Change happens when common people are empowered to fight for their liberation.</p>
		<p>The full scope of Green Empower is still being determined; but: Green Empower may eventually operate as a member owned investing, charity, public interest and progressive activism organization.</p>
		<p>Green Empower will conduct research and create and provide many services and goods. Some of our functions may have to directly compensate for where our society is seriously lacking.</p>
		<p class="bold">A main function of Green Empower will be to generate income in generally non-destructive ways and redistribute that periodically to individuals without discrimination. (Essentially a Universal Basic Income program)</p>
		<p class="bold">A main function of Green Empower will be to provide migratory and travel services. Everyone should have the right to travel, interract with people of different backgrounds and choose where they want to live.</p>
		<p class="bold">A main function of Green Empower will be to engage in and influence politics, primarily in America.</p>
		<p class="bold">A main function of Green Empower will be to establish and facilitate a network of communes for recreational, scientific, social and production purposes.</p>
		<p>I will use this organization to delegate ownership over my projects and research. <strike>I will soon infuse Green Empower with about $3000 in currency and assets.</strike></p>
		<p>I am in the process of drafting initial founding document/documents which will likely be hosted on this website. Concurrently I am also working on marketing, graphics, symbolism and outreach among other things. Email if interested!</p>

		<h1>Services, Issues and Areas of Research</h1>
		<h2>Lower Cost of Living Innovation and Alternatives</h2>
			<p>One great way of lifting people up and bolstering humanity is by increasing access to necessities for life and preferably even the material things that help to satisfy our higher needs.</p>
			<p>A great way to increase access is to lower costs of essential goods through, research, innovation and infastructure investments. Although this action alone is not a solution to inequality or other systemic inadequacies, it is worthwhile.</p>
			<p>At the very least it may help put us (the masses) in a better position to question authority, as we become less preoccupied by lower order needs.</p>
		<h2>Democratic Enforcements, Systems and Services</h2>
			<p>Services and products for administering, building and maintaining democracy in organizational and deliberative bodies.</p>
			<p>This may play into decentralized networking as many things do. A crucial question when it comes to online voting is identity verification and fraud.</p>
			<p>I speculate that a large and highly connected and weighted mesh network of cryptographic identities could go further in solving the identity issue.</p>
		<h2>Social Networking Services</h2>
			<p>Online networking services are essential nowadays. There is a lot of improvement to be made in this space that I will eventually elaborate on.</p>
		<h2>Gaming and Interactive Simulation</h2>
			<h3><a href="http://voxim.org">Voxim</a></h3>
				<p>Voxim stands for Voxel Simulation. It is a video game that I have been planning and researching on for several years.</p>
		<h2>Media, Entertainment, Music and Propaganda</h2>
			<h3><a href="http://greenie.media">Greenie Media</a></h3>
				<p>Greenie Media is a media outlet I have been conceptualized. I'm questioning if it is within our current scope, but for now it stands.</p>
			<!--
			<h3>Ideas</h3>
				<h4>Intellectual Trump</h4>
					<p>What if we had an intellectual figure that energized people in the same way Trump did?</p>
					-->
		<h2>Complex Large Scale Data Manipulation and Management</h2>
			<p>This also plays into decentralization and mesh technologies</p>
		<h2>Mesh and Cryptography</h2>
		<h2>Decentralization</h2>
			<h3>Physical Decentralization</h3>
				<p>Physical decentralization of the means of production is crucial for further development. People should have the same opportunities no matter where they live and access to production plays into that.</p>
				<p>We should no longer be relying on single countries and centralized infastructure and factories for the necessities of modern life. That should be local.</p>
			<h3>Digital Decentralization</h3>
		<h2>Mass Collaboration</h2>
			<p>The internent itself has enabled mass forms of collaboration and cooperation, but there is still more work to do!</p>
		<h2>Travel, Mobility, Migration and Exploration</h2>
			<p>This is a right that we will try to uphold. It is fundamental to modern society.</p>
		<h2>Karma and Social Currency</h2>
			<p><a href="karma">/karma</a></p>
			<p>We will provide a social credit system through Green Empower that will be a service for internal and external use by other organizations.</p>
		<h2>Legal, Judicial and Legislative</h2>
			<p>We will pursue progressive legal actions if and when it's deemed worthwhile.</p>
		<h2>Climate Change</h2>
			<p>This is a huge and existencial issue for the masses. It will likely not impact people equaly based on demographics and socio-economics.</p>
			<p>It is important to me that if we manage to survive climate change that we make sure that the society which emerges was worth fighting for in the first place. Let us hope that history doesn't keep repeating itself in the way it has.</p>
		<h2>Rewilding</h2>
			<p>Modern industrial society and environments can be alienating due to their lack of naturality.</p>
			<p>We should seek to find a better balance keeping in mind nature and naturality. Artificial and natural life don't have to be directly opposed. Nature is based on science and laws just as our machines and materials are....</p>
		<h2>Reverse Engineering and Open Alternatives</h2>
			<p>There is potential in the act of creating alternatives to proprietary software and even direct replacements.</p>
		<h2>Party and Celebration</h2>
			<p>Life should be enjoyable and the right type of festive attitude can help with that and we will facilitate it.</p>
		<h2>Resiliancy Mechanisms</h2>
			<p>We should build machines and such to be more resiliant.</p>
		<h2>Exploitation: Abolition and Human Trafficking</h2>
			<p>Exploitation of all forms is an issue.</p>
			<p>I once was involved with an underground abolition group mainly focused on rescuing minors and stopping their systemic sexual exploitation.</p>
			<p>It was eye opening and disturbing to learn more of the depths of crualty that exist.</p>
			<p>Human trafficking and exploitation are unacceptable and we will do whatever we can to eradicate them.</p>
		<h2>Right to Repair</h2>
			<p>We need to expand right to repair. It is part of a larger pattern of exploitative patterns from large tech companies.</p>
			<p>Thank you <a href="https://www.rossmanngroup.com">Louis Rossmann</a> for your work on this!</p>
		<h2>Standardization</h2>
			<p>Standardization works to enable greater scales of cooperation. For this reason it is a priority.</p>
		<h2>Rights</h2>
		<h3>Civil Rights</h3>
		<h3>Digital Rights</h3>
		<h2>Healthcare</h2>
		<h2>Pharmaceuticals</h2>
			<p>So many people including myself are reliant on pills and pharmaceuticals for living. It is unconscionable that these large exploitative companies, enabled by capitalism and a corrupt patent system, have such a strangle hold over us.</p>
		<h2>Frontiers</h2>
			<p>Frontiers are new areas of exploration. Exploring frontiers offers a way to benefit all of humanity if riches are spread evenly.</p>
		<h3>Space Exploration</h3>
			<p>The benefits of space exploration are great.</p>
		<h2>Anarchist Services and Software</h2>
			<p>There seems to be a need for more anarchist organization administrative protocols and software. This is an area of interest for Green Empower.</p>
		<h2>Liability Management</h2>
			<p>Insurrance. This is an area of need in the US where companies engage in antisocial behavior.</p>
		<h2>Romantic, Sexual and Reproduction</h2>
			<p>Green Empower will facilitate services for people who have trouble finding romantic partners traditionally.</p>
			<p>Everyone deserves a chance to find love and propogate.</p>
		<h2>Language and Linguistics</h2>
			<p>Language manipulation, synthesis and education are areas of interest the Green Empower.</p>
		<h2>Minority Rights and Issues</h2>
			<!--
			<p>The way that we treat the least advantaged and most marginalized among us is very representative of who we are as a people.</p>
			-->
		<h2>Young Persons' Rights and Issues</h2>
		<h2>Sustainability and Environmental Health</h2>
		<h2>Political Work</h2>
			<p>Green Empower will enact programs to change our politics. Green Empower is a political organization.</p>
		<h2>Houselessness</h2>
		<h2>Chemistry</h2>
		<h2>Price Control</h2>
			<p>People deserve to know what they are paying for when they buy something and to have that cost be reasonably pegged to the actual cost of production.</p>
			<p>Green Empower will work to facilitate and work to uphold that ideal.</p>
		<h2>Diplomacy and Outreach</h2>
		<h2>Speculation</h2>
			<p>Speculating is a possible mode of income for Green Empower. I am researching this further.</p>
		<h2>Resource Allocation</h2>
			<p>This plays into resource management.</p>
		<h3>Sharing</h3>
			<p>We need to share more as a species.</p>
		<h2>Experimentation</h2>
			<p>Mass and potentially scientific experimentation to discover new things that cannot be thought of logically or even creatively.</p>
		<h2>Optimization</h2>
			<p>One application of optimization is to produce things necessary for survival using less space or resources. Example: synthesizing food rather than growing it.</p>

		<!--<p>We name <a href="./saints">saints</a> who represent our ideals.</p>-->
		<p>We fix everyday injustices.</p>
		<p>We avoid competition generally in favor of cooperation.</p>
		<p>We are anticapitalist.</p>
		<p>We support rule by the many rather than the few. The many are better equipped to address their issues than the few who are out of touch.</p>
		<p>We question, doubt and challenge power.</p>

		<h2>Internationalism</h2>
			<p>Aspects of Green Empower need to be International. The US government and the Capitalist class have a huge capacity to crush us domenstically. I believe that to overthrow the systems that oppress us we need to seek cooperation abroad.</p>
			<p>Nationalism is a problem. Culture can be exchanged healthilly and fruitfully.</p>

		<br>
			
		<h1>Issues and Areas of Investigation</h1>
		<h2>Inequality</h2>
		<h2>Poverty</h2>
		<h3>Wealth Disparity</h3>
			<p>Wealth Disparity is the most precient disparity that I know of. We are increadibly unequal in the USA and the world when it comes to wealth. This is probably the worst inequality issue, because of it's impact on peoples lives.</p>
			<p>There at least 100k people (probably more) in the USA living with obcene wealth, where others live in squander.</p>
		<h2>Monopoly</h2>
		<h3>Social/Cultural Monopoly</h3>
			<p>It's an issue when groups try to monopolize ideas (ex. The American right tries to monopolize guns and law and order.)</p>
		<h3>Intellectualism</h3>
			<p>I take issue with how academia has monopolized intellectualism. That's an issue, because intellectualism exists outside of academic heirarchy and bureaucracy. When people associate intellectualism with this there is an issue.</p>
		<h4>Productivity</h4>
			<p>Different political groups and entities try to monopolize productivity. You may see a politician, a political pundent or an entire political party trying to suggest that we, he, or she will 'get things done'. This is toxic.</p>
		<h2>Social / Cultural</h2>
			<h3>Social / Cultural Performance</h3>
				<p>People are often coerced into perfoming a role for society that may not benefit them. For example, toxic masculinity may force a young male into being something he is not physically or mentally incline to be. Or, a smart young man may be coerced to act in a scholarly way or to achieve in school, even though this is not his inclination.</p>
			<h3>Unsolicited Advice</h3>
		<h2>Neoliberalism</h2>
			<p>Neoliberalism is weak and reactionary ideology. It can't exist without facism. When facism fades neoliberalism looses its purpose, which is to act as an alternative to facism.</p>
		<h2>Segregation</h2>
		<h2>Oppression</h2>
		<h2>Eugenics</h2>
			<p>This is an issue.</p>

		<h2>Ableism</h2>
		<h2>Conformity</h2>
		<h2>World Bank</h2>
			<p>Aparently the World Bank artificially creates poverty by manufacturing and altering that standard to advance their own aims and make capitalism look good.</p>

		<h2>Propriety</h2>
		<h2>Imperialist and Capitalist Intervention</h2>
			<p>The US and others have famously intervened in communist and socialist experiments.</p>
			<h3>Death Squads</h3>
				<p>In Nicaragua the US funded the Contras to go around and mass rape, torture, mutulate and kill people to stop the Communist Sandenistas.</p>

		<h2>Scarcity</h2>
			<p>How does scarcity effect peoples minds and experiences? Does growing up poor predispose you to act greedily?</p>

		<h2>Overton Window</h2>
		<h2>Bullying</h2>
		<h2>Slavery, Exploitation and Trafficking</h2>
			<h3>Mass Incarceration</h3>
				<p>America has the highest incarceration rate in the world. It is rediculous, disgusting and embarrassing.</p>
			<h3>Human Trafficking</h3>
				<p>Human Trafficking is a global issue. It is abhorrent.</p>
		<h2>Filters</h2>
			<h3>Greed</h3>
			<h3>Brutalism</h3>
			<h3>Self Preservation and Self Centered-ness</h3>
				<p>People with these traits have an advantage in society over people that are not so concerned with themselves sadly. It's why our leadership tends to be so pathetic when compared to the everyday person.</p>
				<p>This is a huge issue for people like me who have mental health and illness issues. We are not always capable of looking after or recognizing threats to our wellbeing. Many of us are very capable, intelligent and creative. While illness needs to be addressed, it's important to recognize that many of our eccentricities are not necessarily 'disabilities' or really even issues for us outside of societal context.</p>


		<br>

		<h1>Reactionary</h1>
		<h2>Capitalism</h2>
			<p>We are proudly anticapitalist. We strive to offer something new, useful and meaningful. Capitalist beliefs aren't going to get us there.</p>
			<h3>Schemery</h3>
				<p>We document capitalist schemery.</p>
		<h2>Intellectualism</h2>
			<p>We are experiencing a rising anti-intellectual movement in America and abroad. It is an issue and is something that needs to be addressed.</p>
		<h2>Intolerance</h2>
			<p>It's hard to be tolerant when in comes to intolerance. Can intolerance be tolerated?</p>
		<h2>Existencialism</h2>
		<h2>Jealousy</h2>

		<br>

		<h1>Philosophy</h1>
		<h2>Just World Falacy</h2>
			<p>Some people seem to have a tendency to think that the way things are is fundimentely just. We feel that people and systems in power should always be questioned, because the world doesn't always lend itself to justice and fairness.</p>
		<h2>Indulgence</h2>
			<p>At what point is self-indulgence dangerous?</p>
		<h2>Virtue</h2>
		<h3>Weakness and Virtue</h3>
			<p>Weakness is not a lack of virtue. Society needs to recognize this.</p>

		<h2>Individualism</h2>
		<h2>Homogeneity</h2>
		<h2>Divide and Conquer.</h2>
		<h2>Divisions</h2>
			<p>How to handle the divisions among us?</p>
		<h2>Spheres of Influence</h2>
		<h2>Freedom</h2>
		<h2>Emotionality</h2>
			<p>I am developing Neo-Emotionality for cultural and propagandistic use.</p>
			<h3>NeoMasculinity</h3>
			<h3>NeoFemininity</h3>
		<h2>Positive Energy</h2>
			<p>Positive Energy is constructive (ex. love and passion).</p>
