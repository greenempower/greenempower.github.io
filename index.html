		<h1>The Green Empower Organization: Drafting and Construction</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the Green Empower Organization.</p>
		<p>My name is Holden Green (<a href="http://holdengreen.org">holdengreen.org</a>). Contact me at <a href="mailto:me@holdengreen.org">me@holdengreen.org</a> if you are interested in becoming a founding member or would otherwise like to engage on the topic of Green Empower.</p>
		<p>Green Empower will initially operate as a member owned investing, charity, public interest and activism organization. We will initially provide a number of digital & online hosting services to our members. These will include but are not limited to: Email, Mastodon, Git & Pages, Wiki and LBRY.</p>
		<p>In the future we will new accept members through a standard process. Only one membership is allowed per person. Members will be required to pay a basic rate to the organization. This rate will likely be somewhere around 50 cents, but is subject to change.</p>
		<p>After a cumulative period of time (possibly 4 years) members will begin to receive periodic kick-back taken as a fraction of organization profit.</p>
		<p>I am in the process of of drafting an initial founding document, which will likely be hosted on this website. I am eager to find like minded people who can contribute!</p>
