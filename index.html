		<h1>The Green Empower Organization</h1>
		<h2>Drafting and Construction</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the Green Empower Organization.</p>
		<p>My name is Holden Green (<a href="http://holdengreen.org">holdengreen.org</a>). Contact me at <a href="mailto:me@holdengreen.org">me@holdengreen.org</a> if you are interested in Green Empower.</p>
		<p>Green Empower will eventually operate as a member owned investing, charity, public interest and progressive activism organization. We will initially provide a number of digital & online hosting services to our members.</p>
		<p><strike>In the future we will accept new members through a standard process. Only one membership is allowed per person. Members will be required to pay a basic rate to the organization. This rate will likely be somewhere around 50 cents, but is subject to change.</strike></p>
		<p><strike>After a cumulative period of time (possibly 4 years) members will begin to receive periodic kick-back taken as a fraction of organization profit.</strike></p>
		<p>A main function of Green Empower will be to generate income in generally non-destructive ways and redistribute that periodically to individuals without discrimination. (Essentially a Universal Basic Income program)</p>
		<p>Initial areas of research include: gaming and interactive simulation <a href="http://voxim.org">(Voxim)</a>, Media & Entertainment <a href="http://greenie.media">(Greenie Media)</a> and Mesh + Cryptography tech.</p>
		<p>I will use this organization to delegate ownership over my projects and research. <strike>I will soon infuse Green Empower with about $3000 in currency and assets.</strike></p>
		<p>I am in the process of drafting initial founding document/documents which will likely be hosted on this website. Concurrently I am also working on marketing, graphics, symbolism and outreach among other things. Email if interested!</p>
