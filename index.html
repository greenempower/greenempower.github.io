		<h1>The Green Empower Organization: Drafting and Construction</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the Green Empower Organization.</p>
		<p>My name is Holden Green (holdengreen.org). Contact me at <a href="mailto:me@holdengreen.org">me@holdengreen.org</a> if you are interested in membership or would otherwise like to engage on the topic of Green Empower.</p>
		<p>Green Empower will initially operate as a member owned investing and charity organization. We will also provide a number of digital & online hosting services to our members. These will include but are not limited to: Email, Mastodon, Git & Pages, Wiki and LBRY.</p>
		<p>We are considering a rate for basic membership starting at $0.25/mo. If deemed practical there may also be a free tear, possibly with a deposite and/or address verification. This tear shall be limited and not abuse the space maintained and owned by paying members. Steps will be taken to insure sanctity of the platform while still allowing equal opportunity to members who cannot pay.</p>
