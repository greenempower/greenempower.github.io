		<!--<p>Green Empower fights terror and imperialism wherever it may be.</p>-->
		<!--<p>We name <a href="./saints">saints</a> who represent our ideals.</p>-->

		<h3>Internationalism</h3>
		<hr class="t3">
				<p>Aspects of Green Empower need to be International. The US government and the Capitalist class have a huge capacity to crush us domestically. I believe that to overthrow the systems that oppress us we need to seek cooperation abroad.</p>
				<p>Nationalism is a problem. Culture can be exchanged healthily and fruitfully.</p>
