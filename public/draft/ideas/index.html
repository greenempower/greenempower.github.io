<h1>GEM Draft: Ideas</h1>

<p>--- Libre Package Bundle ---</p>
<p>A program that coordinates libre services.</p>
<p>Let's you pick and choose paid services and then pay for them all at once automatically.</p>
<p>Tries to integrate and compensate so that your experience using secure libre services is at least comperable to otherwise using properietary stuff.</p>

<p>--- Browser Hypervisor ---</p>
<p>Write a program which supervises browser page instances under it and let's you productively manage many pages at once.</p>
<p>Throttle pages which are hogging resources.</p>


<h2>Cloud Services</h2>
<p>--- ---</p>
<p>An interactive disk image builder with web browser GUI. This as apposed to just choosing some prebuilt distro.</p>

<p>--- SOM Based Server Racks ---</p>
<p>SOM stands for system on a module. SOMS are typically a rectangular PCB with simple leads fabricated to fit into a DIMM slot on a larger board or system.</p>

<p>A SOM typically houses a more or less complete system. It has an SoC (System on a Chip), which is typically ARM based, a small linux capable flash module (typically eMMC) and some RAM.</p>

<p>Providing a cloud service utilizing embedded-type SOMs rather than complete high end x86 systems is potentially highly economical. The current typical retail price of a SOM in question iss ~$30. These SOMs are low power and they often incorporate graphics rendering hardware. Performance wise they are not in the same tier as a modern amd64 processor, although there is potential for SOMs to catch up some with time and investment.</p>

<p>Note: In the future we may create or recieve a RISC-V based SoC SOM, which would be fantastic and superior to ARM and RISC-V is higher performance and lower power (~%40) than ARM.</p>

<p>--- Lightweight Provisioning Standard and API ---</p>
<p>There can be a standard protocol and API for dealing with computing resources (memory, disk, CPU cycles, etc) provisioned to a user.</p>

<p>A typical cloud service (ex. Google Drive) is centralized and largely holds onto it's provisioned resources tightly.</p>

<p>Rather it is more efficient for one or more services to formally provisions their users resources for which they privately own cryptography and/or legally.</p>

<p>In this way the provisioners are essentially providing 'infrastructure as a service' to their users.</p>

<p>The draft API protocol standard is the glue that cleanly empowers users and developers to use their provisions. Their can be one simple and lightweight standard for this that cuts down the bloat of using potentially several propreitary APIs and interfaces.</p>
